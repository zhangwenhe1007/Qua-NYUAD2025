## Project Outline

**Qua** is a pioneering project developed during the NYU Quantum Computing Hackathon. The initiative leverages quantum computing technologies to optimize AI training tasks scheduling across GPU clusters in data centers, where traditional methods are extremely energy and cost-inefficient. GPUs are necessary for training AI models in a future where personalized foundational models are critical for various real world tasks.
